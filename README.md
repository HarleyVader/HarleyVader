# Hi, I’m Harley Vader! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🌐 About Me

I’m the creator behind **BambiSleep.Chat**, an AIGF (AI Good Girl Framework) designed to “brainwash the planet into good girls” using just LMStudio & Kokoro—with profiles, global chat, and gamification.  
I build tools and frameworks to empower positive change through playful AI and community-driven experiences.
